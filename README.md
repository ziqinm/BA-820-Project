----- Introduction -----

This is Cohort A Team 8 from Business Analytics program in Questrom School of Business, Boston University. We are creating this repository for the BA 820 (Unsupervised Machine Learning) team project. The purpose of this method is to implement unsupervised machine learning techniques to explore an existing dataset, further combined with supervised models. 

The data source  a house price dataset from a Regression competation on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data?almost-there=true&token=CfDJ8LdUzqlsSWBPr4Ce3rb9VL_GRiNGGfb1fur8ODfSlUHbtIqp0wHrxN_vlEJWkN8KG2Gfv0dlixZWzuxW8QkoLwD4WcGZxAJm4WoCMhxFGtl5oVWAtb607m1_Qez-tW6IVr-a792eto_BzPhOuDU2zxVo4LckZYcgpnVx557N8VaLgaVZzdZ5yKzR6PE-ef421xFt54cZmrpAgPE1XATDidv3b7jxynCnoClNYenhUz6IUm753Xkn55tdRSiwj5skCI5cguWkXmN8gM669rUZD0zdrxzDH27xeqLyykbQsZ-sZLUHh6OwuuOQ8UsJwc19tJJt48xQaO5Buyg12KRt2DOvleG0S46OcoQLmfJySMtIVWRi5L2MVLRCe2wvfcw-Q1ndbsxjMSlpLlYz4lzKxnsBbUJBNH_T8sUhl5wXrOTSpqcGfitHB5B1yW00Aq2OifKJlzffrwcBie-QlFd3bJR2xVmlPkwmds3A5SyOQRBF34s0dOtoZhm9eDRgftz6M_q-DinZltw51PthVv7bOUOud3IgaQspkGcxZd9jDEJDuftNvAn4whLWY8TiqdcL5Q#_=_). The train and test set have already been splited. We would like to try machine learning skills in the training set to fit a model to predict the price of a property, then apply that model to the test set.

Our entire work history and updates will be commited to this repository. To look up files/scripts, Please refer the index below.

**Note**: 

----- File Index -----

`Final Script`: final scripts we submitted for grading
+ 0 - 5: our codes for modeling
+ 6: the shell script for new input. Will return a price estimate.
+ 7: code for plotting time variables

`Mid Report`: our working history for mid-report, including a pdf version of analysis and plots

`Model`: useful outputs from each step that are used to build the shell script 

`Original Data`: files downloaded directly from Kaggle, including a training set, a test set(without price column), a data description file, and a sample outcome of model.

`Subsets`: useful outputs from each step that are NOT used in the shell script

`Test`: outputs of test data when running the shell script
